5. Logic Building with Arrays

Here’s a thinking trick:

Whenever you face a problem, think:
====================================
Do I need to store multiple related values? → Use array.
Do I need to add/remove items? → push/pop/shift/unshift.
Do I need to transform data? → map.
Do I need to filter out unwanted data? → filter.
Do I need to find something specific? → find/indexOf.
Do I need to sort? → sort.
